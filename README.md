# Diabetes Diagnosis App ‚Äì XGBoost+PSO & Random Forest+PSO

This application is a machine learning-based tool built to predict diabetes using two optimized models: **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**, both enhanced with **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for improved accuracy and performance.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this application is to assist in the **early detection of diabetes** by leveraging optimized machine learning models. It allows users to:
- Quickly predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health input parameters
- Compare the performance of two ML models side by side
- Learn how PSO can significantly improve model effectiveness

## Input Features
The diabetes prediction is based on the following clinical input values provided by the user:

- Gender (Male/Female)
- Age (in years)
- Urea (blood urea level)
- Creatine (serum creatinine level)
- HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c level)
- Cholesterol (total cholesterol level)
- Triglycerides (fat levels in the blood)
- VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein level)
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
